# World of Pokemons

This is an little web application to explore the features of react-query, next.js and many more.
It uses the PokeApi to fetch information about hundreds of wild creatures and give you the opportunity to explore them.

## What you can do?

You are free to explore the different Pokemons by simply scrolling down until you are bord or find something of interest
for you.
When you find a Pokemon that you like you can click on it to get more information about the evolution and more details
about its natural habitat as well as moves and abilities (still in progress).
Of course you can use the infinite scrolling to search as long as you want without fetching all information from the
beginning. We wanted to make sure that a good Performance if provided.

Besides the simple scrolling you are also free to search for a Pokemon by simply typing the name. The search field will
of course provide you with autocompletion if you are not entirely sure how a Pokemon is spelt.

Ah yeah, the last feature is that you are able to see the evolution chain of a pokemon and you can simply level up or
down to a particular pokemon from the chain if you want. Click for that just on the button at the back of you Pokemon
card.

Have fun exploring the world of Pokemons.

Cheers
