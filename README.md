# World of Pokemons

You can explore the different Pokemon by simply scrolling down until you get bored or you find something interesting.

When you find a Pokemon you like, you can click on it to get more information about its evolution. You will also find more details
about the natural habitat, as well as about its movements and abilities (still in progress).

Of course, you can use infinite scrolling to search as long as you like without having to retrieve all the information from the beginning. We wanted to make sure that a good performance is offered.

Besides just scrolling, you can also search for a Pokemon by simply typing in its name. The search box offers
of course autocompletion if you're not quite sure how a Pokemon is spelt.

Oh yes, the last feature is that you can see a Pokemon's evolutionary chain and easily level up or down a Pokemon.
To do this, click on one of the names in the chain on the back of a Pokemon card.

Have fun exploring the world of Pokemons.

## How to get it running?

1. First clone the repo
2. Install the dependencies `npm install`
3. Launch the app locally `npm run dev` **or** build the production code and run the code in your
   browser `npm run build`
   and `npm run start`

## Feedback

I use this app for small demo purposes and you can play around with different features.

In any case, the app is far from finished, so if you want to contribute or have some nice feedback on features you would like to see or improvements that would make it easier to use, feel free to drop me a line.

Any kind of feedback is always welcome.

Make the project your own!

Best wishes
